THE PREFACE.

of Muriel, the widow of Malis seneschal of Stratherne (appended to No. 16
of Appendix to Preface) gives a shield of the two cheverons, supported by
a man’s arm, on whose fist a falcon is perehed. It is represented imper-
feotly at the end of the Prefaoe to the Register of the Bishoprio of Moray.
But one seal is preserved of higher antiquity‚ and of much interest to the
herald and the genealogist. It is the seal of Earl Gilbert, appended to the
charter of Trinity Gask‚ in the charter·ohest of the Duke of AthoL (printed
in the Appendix to the Profaoe, N ο. 5) which gives on the obverse a
mounted knight with drawn swerd, the horse galloping‚ a housing very
short and fitting to the horse's body, ornamented with points below—no
ooat armour or bearing on the shield; the circumscription mostly gone, but
the word comus still legible. On the reverse is a small oounterseaL a. shield

of armS, with the legend—

ssscssmvu · G · comme 1313 STRADERRE.
